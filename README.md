>Hi, I’m Dhanush—a DevSecOps Engineer at the intersection of innovation, security, and cross-platform agility. My role isn’t just about bridging development and operations; it’s about weaving security into the DNA of every build, deployment, and runtime environment across iOS, Android, Windows, macOS, Linux, and beyond. I thrive in the chaos of multi-platform complexity, turning fragmented workflows into cohesive, automated pipelines that ship secure software faster.  
> 
>My days revolve around architecting *CI/CD pipelines* that don’t just work but defend. Using Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or GitLab CI/CD, I design systems that build, test, and deploy code seamlessly across operating systems while embedding security at every layer—SAST/DAST scans, dependency checks, secret detection—so vulnerabilities die early, not in production. I automate the grind: signing macOS binaries, pushing Android APKs to Play Store, hardening container images, and ensuring every artifact is both platform-perfect and compliance-ready.  
> 
>Security isn’t a step; it’s the rhythm. I bake it into the SDLC with tools like Snyk and Trivy for dependency vetting, OWASP ZAP for penetration testing, and RASP to shield apps at runtime. When infrastructure is involved, I speak *Infrastructure as Code* fluently—Terraform templates, Kubernetes manifests, Dockerfiles—to spin up identical, secure environments whether we’re on AWS, Azure, or bare metal. Secrets? They’re locked in vaults (literally, HashiCorp Vault) with RBAC policies tighter than a submarine hatch.  
> 
>Cross-platform builds are my playground. I troubleshoot Android SDK quirks, wrangle Windows DLL conflicts, and optimize PWAs for six browsers at once. My git branches are a symphony of trunk-based releases and gitflow discipline, ensuring features land consistently across devices. Release days? I orchestrate them like a conductor—versioning artifacts, drafting bulletproof release notes, and prepping rollback plans before the first user even hits “update.”  
> 
>But I don’t just build systems; I guard them. With Prometheus and Grafana, I track metrics like a hawk—build success rates, vulnerability SLAs, mean time to remediate. When incidents strike, I’m knee-deep in logs with Splunk or ELK, leading post-mortems that turn outages into bulletproof playbooks.  
> 
>Collaboration fuels me. I partner with developers to squash insecure code before it’s written, train QA teams on platform-specific security quirks, and document everything—runbooks, signing procedures, even how to dodge macOS notarization pitfalls. Workshops? I run them like TED Talks, demystifying DevSecOps tools or explaining why Rust might save our next build system.  
> 
>Innovation is non-negotiable. I experiment with WASM sandboxes for safer browser runs, optimize pipelines with parallel jobs and cloud bursting, and obsess over platform advisories—Android CVEs, Linux kernel patches—to keep our tech stack ahead of exploits.  
> 
>At my core, I’m a problem-solver who sees platforms not as silos but as pieces of a bigger puzzle. Every line of code I secure, every pipeline I streamline, and every cross-platform quirk I unravel isn’t just a task—it’s a step toward software that’s as resilient as it is revolutionary.  
>

> 
>*TL;DR:* *I break down walls between dev, sec, and ops to build software that’s secure by default, agile by design, and flawless across *every screen. Let’s ship it.**
